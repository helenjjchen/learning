After tech stocks were pummeled on Friday, the sector is selling off again to start the week.

Just before noon Eastern, the Nasdaq was down 0.6%, or down about 40 points. The Dow and S&P 500 had also pared some losses, with the Dow off 40 points and the S&P down about 6.

Shortly after the market open, the Nasdaq had been down more than 1.3%, or 85 points, far outpacing losses from the Dow and the benchmark S&P 500. Near 9:50 a.m. ET the Dow was off 62 points, or 0.3%, and the S&P 500 was down 9 points, or 0.4%. On Friday, the Nasdaq fell 1.8% while the Dow actually finished in the green.

Major tech names selling off early Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), down over 4%, AMD (AMD), down 5%, Microsoft (MSFT), down about 3%, and Amazon (AMZN) also off about 3%. Near noon Eastern, Nvidia shares had erased all of their early losses while AMD, Microsoft, and Amazon were still in the red.
